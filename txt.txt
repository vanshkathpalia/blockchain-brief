object or function 
object when dec -> ({}) and when defining -> () {} me difference h
: = and ; , 
_ or const ka difference h


_ : , -> varaible passed
const = ; / -> this. ... = ; this is an object, defined
//edit this, still confused


FOR ADDING NONCE -
we changed file block this. 
, genesis config file, mineblock static function, isvalid function -> if found that i hadn't passed data in there
don't forget to enter it in return 

FOR ADJUSTING THE DIFFICULTY LEVEL - 
we pass mine rate from config so that we can use it for other purposes 
difficulty shouldn't de declared at const now

FOR SCOPE OF BETTER DIFFICULTY LEVEL - 
hexadecimal is actually 0 and 1 even if in our hexadecimal no 0 we can have that in binary 
-> averagetime.js file for this purpose to create so many blocks -> issue here was no value was shown for avg time... because in genesis block every random input was entered by me earlier 
-> another issue was that difficulty was not inc or dec only the 1st value was changing if required because in addblock function prev should be current - 1 not chain[0] 

-> publishSub.js error
json.stirbngfy creating problem and also if normal messafe is passed in publish function handle function not running
